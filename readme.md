Adobe Platform Libraries
=====

This started out as a fork from Adobe's original ASL Perforce server, but has since been undergoing development. Please contact the project owners if you have any questions or comments.

If you're trying to build this without the Adobe Source Libraries, you're going to have a bad time.

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/stlab/adobe_platform_libraries) to validate APL's build state. A build consists of building Adobe Begin with xcodebuild in debug mode.
